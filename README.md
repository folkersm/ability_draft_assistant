This is a data analysis tool meant to be used during the drafting phase of Dota 2's ability draft game mode. 
The app is currently hosted at: https://folkersm-ability-draft-assistant-app-4qebys.streamlit.app/ 

Design problems:
The main bottleneck for using this app is that for it to be effective, you need to input the ability pool that's randomly generated at the beginning of the drafting phase. 
The process of entering this data takes up valuable time that you want to spend thinking about the ability pool. 

Future work on this project (if that happens) will include:
- adding icons to the abilities
- adding a feature to remove abilities from the list as they're drafted (ambitiously, to automatically remove them)
- improve win percent calculation (factor in attack type options, counter pick data)
- color code abilities when there is a synergy
- change the synergies section to only include abilities in the pool
- fix the hero selector (currently it just doesn't work, but you can simulate it with the ability selector section)
- indicate potential synergies as well as current ones.
